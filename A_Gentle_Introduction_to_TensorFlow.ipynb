In this tutorial, we are going to take a step back and review some of the basic components of building a deep learning model using TensorFlow. \n",

        "If fact, it is so basic that it's ideal for those starting to learn about TensorFlow and Deep Learning. So if you have a friend or colleague who wants to jump in, I highly encourage you to refer them to this tutorial as a starting point. Let's get started!\n",
