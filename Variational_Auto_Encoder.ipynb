        "Just as a standard autoencoder, a variational autoencoder is an architecture composed of both an encoder and a decoder and that is trained to minimise the reconstruction error between the encoded-decoded data and the initial data. However, in order to introduce some regularisation of the latent space, we proceed to a slight modification of the encoding-decoding process: instead of encoding an input as a single point, we encode it as a distribution over the latent space. The model is then trained as follows:\n",
        "* the input is encoded as distribution over the latent space\n",
        "* a point from the latent space is sampled from that distribution\n",
        "* the sampled point is decoded and the reconstruction error can be computed\n",
        "* the reconstruction error is backpropagated through the network\n",
