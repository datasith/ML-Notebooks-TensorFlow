# üêô ML Notebooks (TensorFlow)

Inspired by [@DAIR.AI](https://github.com/dair-ai/ML-Notebooks)'s fantastic collection of Machine Learning notebooks, this repository contains the TensorFlow implementation of their Notebooks. These contain code examples for all sorts of machine learning tasks and applications. The notebooks are meant to be minimal and easily reusable and extendable. You are free to use them for educational and research purposes.
