We used the fundamental components that make up a neural network model such as the Sequential class, Dense layer, optimizer, and loss function. We then trained the model and tested its predictive capabilities. Having seen this, you are well on your way to become more knowledgeable about deep learning and TensorFlow. I have provided a bunch of references below if you are interested in practicing and learning more. \n",
